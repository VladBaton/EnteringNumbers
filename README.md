# EnteringNumbers
When I first tried C# I realized, that I can't write command that will receive several inputs(like integers or floats) like I did it in c++. For example, in c++ I can write 

int a,b;

cin >> a >> b; 

I don't know, how to do the same in c#. So I created my solution. Surprisingly, it solves more general problem.
